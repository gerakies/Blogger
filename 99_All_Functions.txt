The provided Python code contains several functions related to a blogging program. Here is the documentation for each function:

1. `create_post()`: This function is used to create a new blog post. It prompts the user to enter the content of the blog post and saves it to a file with a title based on the creation time. The function also calculates the day, month, and delta since the author's birthdate.

2. `check_yesno(question)`: This is a sub-function that asks the user a yes/no question and returns `True` or `False` based on their response.

3. `keep_headers(filename)`: This is a sub-function that preserves the first two sentences of a file when editing. It reads the file, tokenizes the text into sentences, and extracts the first two sentences.

4. `rename_files(old_suffix, new_suffix)`: This sub-function renames files in the current directory by replacing the old suffix with a new suffix. It retrieves the list of files, checks if the file ends with the old suffix, constructs a new file name, and performs the renaming operation.

5. `display_header()`: This sub-function displays a banner/header for the blogging program.

6. `sort_posts(suffix)`: This sub-function displays the headers of all files with a specific suffix and returns a sorted list of the file names.

7. `view_posts(suffix)`: This sub-function displays the content of each file with a specific suffix. It uses `sort_posts(suffix)` to retrieve the sorted list of files and prints the wrapped content of each file.

8. `create_zip()`: This function allows the user to archive blog posts from a specific year into a zip file. It prompts the user to enter a year, creates a zip file with all the posts from that year, and optionally deletes the original post files.

9. `count_files(file_mask)`: This sub-function counts the number of files based on a provided file mask.

10. `statistics()`: This function displays statistics about the files in the current directory. It categorizes the files based on their extensions and counts the number of files in each category.

11. `view_log()`: This function displays the content of the log file.

12. `edit_posts(suffix)`: This function allows the user to edit a selected blog post. It prompts the user to choose a post, displays the current content, and allows them to enter new content.

13. `post_option(suffix)`: This sub-function is used by `edit_posts()` and `delete_posts()` to display a numbered list of posts with a specific suffix and prompts the user to choose a post by number. It returns the selected post number and the list of files.

14. `delete_posts(suffix)`: This function allows the user to delete a selected blog post. It renames the post file with a different suffix to indicate that it has been deleted.

15. `recover_posts(suffix)`: This function allows the user to recover a previously deleted blog post. It renames the post file to its original suffix.

16. `append_posts(suffix)`: This function allows the user to append new content to a selected blog post. It prompts the user to choose a post, displays the current content, and allows them to enter additional content.

17. `write_log(filename, action, text)`: This sub-function writes log entries to a log file. It appends a log entry containing the filename, action, and additional text with a timestamp.

18. `merge_all_blogs(suffix)`: This function merges all blog posts with a specific suffix into a single file named "All_Blogs.txt". It concatenates the content of the blog posts and saves them to the output file. Optionally, it can archive the individual blog posts.

19. `main()`: This is the main function that runs the blogging program. It displays a menu to the user and executes the corresponding functions based on their choices.

20. `additional_functions()`: This sub-function displays an additional menu with extra commands and provides options like viewing archives, file statistics, log file, and more.

Please note that some functions rely on external modules such as `nltk`, `os`, `time`, `textwrap`, `datetime`, `glob2`, `password`, and `zipfile`, which are imported at the beginning of the code.
