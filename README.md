Stand alone Diary Blogger not internet connected
Introduction. I designed this blog/diary in April 2023 as a way of capturing the day to day minutiae of my life. More and more is lost to memory and I have increasingly found my memory to be at variance  with those around me. So I designed a system that was very quick and simple to record my thoughts and events. I decided to employ a numbering system based on the number of days that I have been alive, hence day 24272 or whatever. It came from a distant memory of the opening sequence of the TV series of Star Trek when Captain Kirk would always start with "Captain's log Star Date 32756". So you'll have to adjust that date setting.
